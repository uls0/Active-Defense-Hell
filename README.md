# HELL: Honeypot Exploitation & Lethal Logging
## Ultimate Active Defense & Intelligence Infrastructure

HELL v5.0.0 is the definitive version of the autonomous counter-offensive system. It combines deep protocol deception with a permanent intelligence engine that tracks and accumulates damage against adversarial actors.

### Ultimate Specifications (v5.0.0-Gold)

- **Permanent Threat Tracking:**
    - **Damage Accumulator:** Persistent tracking of every IP address. Logs show the *Total Life Loss* (time wasted) and *Total Garbage Injected* across all sessions.
    - **Bot Classification:** Real-time identification of threat types (AI Thief, AD Crawler, Ransomware Bot, etc.).
- **Deep Forensics & Fingerprinting:**
    - **ISP & ASN Mapping:** Automatic identification of the attacker's network provider and infrastructure type (DataCenter, VPN, Proxy, or Residential).
    - **Reverse DNS Lookup:** Resolves hostnames to uncover hidden infrastructure.
- **Advanced Anchoring (The Sticky Trap):**
    - **Drip-Feed delivery:** Data is served byte-by-byte with randomized delays to keep bot timeouts from triggering.
    - **Heartbeat Keep-Alive:** Injects invisible traffic to maintain connection persistence for hours.
- **Enterprise Deception Suite:**
    - **MEX-AD-CORP:** Full simulation of a Mexican Active Directory environment.
    - **Lethal SMB Submodule:** Compression bombs and infinite share mazes.
    - **AI Protection:** Zlib bombs for Ollama, ComfyUI, and LM Studio.

### Operational Metrics

The system now logs:
1. **Connection Profile:** Detects if the attacker is hiding behind a Proxy or attacking from a professional Hosting service.
2. **Persistence Duration:** Real-time and cumulative time the attacker has been trapped.
3. **Data Impact:** Volume of null-data and logic bombs successfully processed by the attacker.

### Security Disclaimer
This system is strictly for defensive research. Operation should comply with local legal frameworks.
